        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The first web browser was invented in 1990 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>. It was called WorldWideWeb (no spaces) and was later renamed Nexus. In 1993, Marc Andreesen created a browser that was easy to use and install with the release of Mosaic (later Netscape), "the world's first popular browser", which made the World Wide Web system easy to use and more accessible to the average person. Andreesen's browser sparked the internet boom of the 1990s.</p>
        <p>The browser wars put the Web in the hands of millions of ordinary PC users, but showed how commercialization of the Web could stymie standards efforts. Both Microsoft and Netscape liberally incorporated proprietary extensions to HTML in their products, and tried to gain an edge by product differentiation, leading to the acceptance of the Cascading Style Sheets proposed by Hakon Wium Lie over Netscape's JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS) by W3C.</p>

            <p>The first Internet Explorer was derived from Spyglass Mosaic. The original Mosaic came from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic">NCSA</a>, but since NCSA was a public entity, it relied on Spyglass as its commercial licensing partner.</p>
            <p>In March 2009, Version 8.0 was released, offering better support for web standards with improvements to RSS, CSS, and Ajax.</p>

            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a>'s Eric Schmidt initially opposed the development of an independent web browser but later changed his mind after seeing an internal Chrome prototype.</p>
            <p>In December 2010, Google introduced an official Chrome MSI package for businesses.</p>

            <p>The project that became Firefox started as an experimental branch of the Mozilla Suite called mozilla/browser. After further development, binaries for public testing appeared in September 2002 under the name Phoenix.</p>
            <p>Firefox 23 was released in August 2013, featuring an updated logo, mixed content blocking, and a global browser console.</p>
